# image_identification_apis

#Ruby code will identify the input images:
#I have used this in one of the project to identify the flower pictured in images.
#API's i have used are: 1. #CLOUDSIGHT will provide only name in response 2. #JUSTVISUAL response will return many identical/related results
#JUSTVISUAL has great API's to identify different segments for Images. I have used it to identify the Flowers.
